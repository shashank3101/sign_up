example_project
===============

An example project demonstrating the power of ``django-rest-authemail``.


Features
--------

- Easy to set up.
- Can be used to test ``django-rest-authemail``.
- Demonstrates how to use ``django-rest-authemail``.
- Can be extended to AngularJS front end clients and iOS/Android mobile apps.


Installation
------------

Create a virtual environment and activate it.

.. code-block:: python

    virtualenv -p /usr/local/bin/python2.7 ~/.virtualenvs/authemail-2.7.6
    source ~/.virtualenvs/authemail-2.7.6/bin/activate

Clone the ``django-rest-authemail`` repo and change into the ``example_project`` directory.

.. code-block:: python

    git clone https://github.com/celiao/django-rest-authemail.git
    cd django-rest-authemail/example_project

Install the required packages into your virtual environment.  Edit ``requirements.txt`` beforehand, if you are using a version of Django other than 1.7.

.. code-block:: python

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Copy the ``setting_email.py.TEMPLATE`` file to ``settings_email.py`` and add your email settings.

The setting AUTH_EMAIL_VERIFICATION (default: True) can be set to False, if you don't want email verification to be performed.

.. code-block:: python

    cp example_project/settings_email.py.TEMPLATE example_project/settings_email.py
    vim example_project/settings_email.py

Use one of the following steps to create the database tables:

1. For Django >= 1.7, create the database tables with Django's ``migrate`` and create a superuser with ``createsuperuser``.

.. code-block:: python

    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py createsuperuser

2. For Django < 1.7, create the database tables with ``syncdb`` and South's ``migrate``.  Create a superuser if not prompted during ``syncdb``.

.. code-block:: python

    python manage.py syncdb
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py createsuperuser

3. To migrate from Django 1.6.X to 1.7, upgrade ``django-rest-authemail``, uninstall ``south``, and bring the migrations up-to-date with ``migrate``.

.. code-block:: python

    pip install --upgrade django-rest-authemail
    pip uninstall south
    python manage.py migrate

Usage
-----

Test ``django-rest-authemail``.  There shouldn't be any failures, but if there are, try to address them (most likely in your email settings).  Go onto the next step for more clues, if you get stuck.

.. code-block:: python

    python manage.py test authemail

Check your setup by starting a Web server on your local machine.

.. code-block:: python

    python manage.py runserver

Direct your browser to the ``Django`` ``/admin`` interface, and log in.  You should see ``Users``, ``Verified users``, ``Groups``, ``Password reset codes``, ``Signup codes``, and ``Tokens``. If you click on ``Users``, you should see your superuser account.

.. code-block:: python

    http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin

Begin the playing with ``django-rest-authemail`` by going to the ``/landing`` page.

.. code-block:: python

    http://127.0.0.1:8000/landing

Click on the ``Signup`` link, or go to the ``/signup`` page directly.

.. code-block:: python

    http://127.0.0.1:8000/signup

Enter your signup details.  A verification email will be sent to the email address you enter, so include an email address to which you have access (but not the superuser email you entered earlier).  If you don't see the email in your inbox, check your spam folder.

Once you have entered your signup information and submitted the form, open up a new tab in your browser and go to the ``Django`` ``/admin``.  Click on ``Signup codes`` to see the newly issued code. A new ``User`` will have been created with your email address, but will not yet appear under ``Verified users``.

Go to the inbox for your email address and click on the link in the verification email.  The ``code`` in the email should match that in the database.

Go back to the ``Django`` ``/admin`` and check that the ``Signup code`` has been removed and that your email address appears on the ``Verified users`` list.

Now, go back to the ``Email Verified`` page and click on the ``Login`` link, or go to the ``/login`` page directly.

.. code-block:: python

    http://127.0.0.1:8000/login

Login with your credentials.  Go back to the ``Django`` ``/admin`` and click on ``Tokens`` to see your newly issued authorization token.

Go back to your ``Home`` page and click on the ``Logout`` button.  You will be returned to the ``/landing`` page.

Click on the ``Login`` link and check out the ``Forgot Password`` functionality.

Login and check out the ``Change Password`` functionality.  Logout and log in again to confirm that your password has been changed.

Enter incorrect email addresses and passwords to exercise the error messages.

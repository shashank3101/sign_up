django-rest-authemail
=====================

``django-rest-authemail`` is a Django/Python application that provides a RESTful API interface for user signup and authentication.  Email addresses are used for authentication, rather than usernames.  Because the authentication user model is based on Django's ``AbstractBaseUser`` and is itself abstract, the model can be extended without the need for additional database tables.  Token authentication allows the API to be accessed from a variety of front ends, including Django, AngularJS clients, and iOS and Android mobile apps.


Features
--------

- UPDATED for Django 1.9.
- Supports and tested with Django 1.6.5, 1.6.7, and 1.7.
- API endpoints for signup, signup email verification, login, logout, password reset, password reset verification, password change, and user detail.
- Extensible abstract user model.
- Perform password confirmation and other client-side validation on the front end for a better user experience.
- Token authentication.
- User models in the admin interface include inlines for signup and password reset codes.
- Uses the Django REST Framework.
- An example project is included and contains example UI templates.
- Supports and tested under Python 2.7.6


Installation
------------

``django-rest-authemail`` is available on the Python Package Index (PyPI) at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-rest-authemail.

Install ``django-rest-authemail`` using one of the following techniques.

- Use ``pip``:

::

    pip install django-rest-authemail

- Download the ``.tar.gz`` file from PyPI and install it yourself

.. _requests: http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest

Usage
-----

In the ``settings.py`` file of your project, include ``rest_framework`` and ``rest_framework.authtoken`` in ``INSTALLED_APPS``. Set the authentication scheme for the Django REST Framework to ``TokenAuthentication``.

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        #'south',        # Remove comment if you're using South for migrations.
        'rest_framework',
        'rest_framework.authtoken',
        ...
    )

    REST_FRAMEWORK = {
        'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': (
            'rest_framework.authentication.TokenAuthentication',
        )
    }

Optionally, you may add a ``AUTH_EMAIL_VERIFICATION`` setting to specify whether to enable email verification for new users on account registration/signup. Setting this to ``False`` will automatically verify newly created users.

Create a Django application for your user data.  For example,

.. code-block:: python

    python manage.py startapp accounts

In the ``models.py`` file of your application, extend ``EmailAbstractUser``, add custom fields, and assign ``objects`` to ``EmailUserManager()``.  For example,

.. code-block:: python

    from django.db import models
    from authemail.models import EmailUserManager, EmailAbstractUser

    class MyUser(EmailAbstractUser):
        # Custom fields
        date_of_birth = models.DateField('Date of birth', null=True, 
            blank=True)

        # Required
        objects = EmailUserManager()

In the ``settings.py`` file of your project, include ``authemail`` and your application in ``INSTALLED_APPS``. Set ``AUTH_USER_MODEL`` to the class of your user model.  For example,

.. code-block:: python

    AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'accounts.MyUser'

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        #'south',        # Remove comment if you're using South for migrations.
        'rest_framework',
        'rest_framework.authtoken',
        'authemail',
        'accounts',
        ...
    )

In the ``admin.py`` file of your application, extend ``EmailUserAdmin`` to add your custom fields.  For example,

.. code-block:: python

    from django.contrib import admin
    from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
    from authemail.admin import EmailUserAdmin

    class MyUserAdmin(EmailUserAdmin):
        fieldsets = (
            (None, {'fields': ('email', 'password')}),
            ('Personal Info', {'fields': ('first_name', 'last_name')}),
            ('Permissions', {'fields': ('is_active', 'is_staff', 
                                           'is_superuser', 'is_verified', 
                                           'groups', 'user_permissions')}),
            ('Important dates', {'fields': ('last_login', 'date_joined')}),
            ('Custom info', {'fields': ('date_of_birth',)}),
        )

    admin.site.unregister(get_user_model())
    admin.site.register(get_user_model(), MyUserAdmin)

Use one of the following steps to create the database tables:

1. For Django >= 1.7, create the database tables with Django's ``makemigrations``, ``migrate`` and create a superuser with ``createsuperuser``.

.. code-block:: python

    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py createsuperuser

2. For Django < 1.7, create the database tables with ``syncdb`` and South's ``migrate``.  Set up a superuser when prompted by ``syncdb``.  Convert your ``accounts`` application to South.  You will receive an error message from South, so fake the initial migration as a workaround (see http://south.aeracode.org/ticket/1179).

.. code-block:: python

    python manage.py syncdb
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py convert_to_south accounts
    python manage.py migrate accounts 0001 --fake

3. To migrate from Django 1.6.X to 1.7, upgrade ``django-rest-authemail``, uninstall ``south``, and bring the migrations up-to-date with ``migrate``.

.. code-block:: python

    pip install --upgrade django-rest-authemail
    pip uninstall south
    python manage.py migrate

Check your setup by starting a Web server on your local machine:

.. code-block:: python

    python manage.py runserver

Direct your browser to the ``Django`` ``/admin`` and log in.

.. code-block:: python

    127.0.0.1:8000/admin

You should see ``Users``, ``Groups``, ``Password reset codes``, ``Signup codes``, and ``Tokens``.  If you click on ``Users``, you should see your superuser account.

Add the ``authemail`` API endpoints to your project's ``urls.py`` file.  For example,

.. code-block:: python

    from accounts import views

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),

        url(r'^api/accounts/', include('authemail.urls')),
    )

When users signup or reset their password, they will be sent an email with a link and verification code.  Include email settings in your project's ``settings.py`` file.  See https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#email-host for more information.  For example,

.. code-block:: python

    # Email settings
    DEFAULT_EMAIL_FROM = 'your_email_address@gmail.com'
    DEFAULT_EMAIL_BCC = ''

    EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
    EMAIL_PORT = 587
    EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'your_email_address@gmail.com'
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx'
    EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
    EMAIL_USE_SSL = False
    SERVER_EMAIL = 'your_email_address@gmail.com'

Try out ``authemail`` API calls by firing up ``python`` and using the ``authemail`` wrapper methods (``runserver`` should still be executing).  For example,

.. code-block:: python

    python
    >>> from authemail import wrapper
    >>> account = wrapper.Authemail()
    >>> first_name = 'Your first name'
    >>> last_name = 'Your last name'
    >>> email = 'your_email@gmail.com'
    >>> password = 'Your password'
    >>> response = account.signup(first_name=first_name, last_name=last_name,
    ... email=email, password=password)

In the ``Django`` ``/admin``, you should see a new user (not verified) and a new signup code.  You should receive an email at ``your_email@gmail.com``.  Use the code in the email to verify your email address using the wrapper (normally, the link in the email would point to the front end, which would issue the signup verify request to the API):

.. code-block:: python

    >>> code = '7f31e7a515df266532df4e00e0cf1967a7de7d17'
    >>> response = account.signup_verify(code=code)

In the ``Django`` ``/admin``, the new user is now verified and the signup code is absent.  The new user can now login and you can inspect the associated login token:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> response = account.login(email=email, password=password)
    >>> account.token
    u'a84d062c1b60a36e6740eb60c6f9da8d1f709322'

You will find the same token for the user in the ``Token`` table in the ``Django`` ``/admin``.  Find out more information about the user (insert your token):

.. code-block:: python

    >>> token = 'a84d062c1b60a36e6740eb60c6f9da8d1f709322'
    >>> response = account.users_me(token=token)
    >>> response
    {u'first_name': u'Your first name', u'last_name': u'Your last name', u'email': u'your_email@gmail.com'}

Use the authentication token to logout:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> response = account.logout(token=token)
    >>> response
    {u'success': u'User logged out.'}

Play with password reset and change!

If you are having trouble getting your code to execute, or are just curious, try out the Django REST Framework Browsable API.  If you type an ``authemail`` API endpoint into your browser, the Browsable API should appear (``runserver`` should still be executing).  For example,

.. code-block:: python

    127.0.0.1/api/accounts/signup

In the ``Content:`` field of the Browsable API, type:

.. code-block:: python

    {
        "first_name": "Your first name",
        "last_name": "Your last name",
        "email": "your_email@gmail.com",
        "password": "Your password"
    }

Then click on ``POST``.  You will either receive an error message to help in your debugging, or, if your signup was successful:

.. code-block:: python

    {
        "first_name": "Your first name",
        "last_name": "Your last name",
        "email": "your_email@gmail.com",
    }

Try out the other ``authemail`` API endpoints with the Django REST Framework Browsable API.

Make ``authemail`` API calls with front end code.  To get started, follow the steps in the ``README.rst`` for the ``example_project``.  Enhance the Django code in the ``example_project`` or extend the concepts to AngularJS, iOS, and Android front ends.

When calling endpoints from the front end that require authentication (``logout``, ``password/change``, and ``users/me``), include the authorization token key in the HTTP header.  For example,

.. code-block:: python

    Authorization: Token 9944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0e4bbdfc6ee4b

Here's an example using ``curl``,

.. code-block:: python

    curl -X GET 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/logout' \
         -H 'Authorization: Token 9944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0e4bbdfc6ee4b'


Authemail API Endpoints
-----------------------
For the endpoints that follow, the base path is shown as ``/api/accounts``.  This path is for example purposes.  It can be customized in your project's ``urls.py`` file.

**POST /api/accounts/signup**

Call this endpoint to sign up a new user and send a verification email.  Sample email templates are found in ``authemail/templates/authemail``.  To override the email templates, copy and modify the sample templates, or create your own, in ``your_app/templates/authemail``.

Your front end should handle password confirmation, and if desired, require the visitor to input their first and last names.

Unverified users can sign up multiple times, but only the latest signup code will be active.

Wrapper
-------
A wrapper is available to access the Authemail API with Python code.  First create an instance of the Authemail class, then call methods to access the API.  There is a one-to-one mapping between the endpoints and instance methods.  For example,

.. code-block:: python

    from authemail import wrapper

    account = wrapper.Authemail()
    response = account.signup(first_name=first_name, last_name=last_name,
        email=email, password=password)

    if 'detail' in response:
        # Handle error condition
    else:
        # Handle good response

See ``example_project/views.py`` for more sample usage.
